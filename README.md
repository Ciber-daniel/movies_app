# Movie Listing App

This is a movie listing application built with Vue.js. It allows users to search for movies by title, year, or rating, and displays a list of matching results. Users can click on a movie to view its details, including the title, year, rating, and plot summary. The application uses an external API to fetch movie data and Vue Router for navigation between pages.
